1. Scope & Timeline
========

1.01 About the Project Scope
----------------------------

Before we begin development on your project, we'll develop a scope for the project. If you are unfamiliar,
a project scope is simply a document that details exactly what we're going to accomplish with this project.

1.02 Our Thoughts on Scope
-------------------------

Please understand that changes to the scope can (and usually will) affect the timeline and budget of the project.

1.03 Making Changes to the Scope
----------------------------------

Any additional development needed above and beyond what we have agreed to here must be accompanied by an additional contract which we will be happy to provide upon request. We retain the right to refuse additional work that is not specifically outlined in this document.

1.04 Timeline
------------
This project is scheduled to begin <%= config['project_start_date'] || "as soon as possible" %> and will last <%= "#{config['project_duration']} #{config['project_time_unit']}" %>.

**Once we received a signed copy of this agreement and the deposit stipulated in Payment Section, work can begin.**

Below is the milestone schedule (with # of <%= config['project_time_unit'] %> in parenthesis):

<% if config['project_milestones'] %>
  <% config['project_milestones'].each_with_index do |content, index| %>
    <%= "1.04.#{(index + 1).to_s.rjust(2, '0')}: #{content.rjust(80, " ")}" %>
  <% end %>

<% else %>
  <%= "None" %>
<% end %>

This contract will be declared complete when all work, within scope, is complete and has been paid in full.
