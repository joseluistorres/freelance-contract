6. Payments
========

6.01 Summary
-------------
We are sure you understand how important it is that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly.  As we're also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tightly to the following payment schedule.

6.02 Payment Schedule
----------------------

We bill every other week on Friday and all invoices are payable upon receipt.

A deposit of $ <%= config['deposit_amount'] %> is due up front and will be subtracted from the last invoice.

6.03 Late Payments
-------------------
Any payments not received within 7 days will halt work until the payment is received. If payment is late twice during the project, we retain the right to ask for prepayment of hours or to end the project, whichever we deem more fitting for the situation.

6.04 Terminating Contract
--------------------------
If either party chooses to end the project, it must be done in writing. Please keep in mind that the deposit will be forfeit and any work that has been paid for up to that point will be turned over to you.
