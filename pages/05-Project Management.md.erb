4. Project Management
==================

4.01 Summary
----------------------
If you do not have a preferred project management tool, we will provide you with a login for ours where you will be able to see the status of the project down to the specific task, so you will always be kept up to date. We'll be relying on you to participate by answering our questions, stating your approval, requesting changes, and verifying completeness through the tool as well. We ask for a one business day turnaround time on responses so we can keep things moving along at a pace that will allow us to hit the milestones we decided on together. 

4.02 Project Management Communications
-------------------------------------
To keep the project organized and the management of it easier, we prefer not to communicate any of the information stated above over ordinary email.
