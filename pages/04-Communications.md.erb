3. Contact
==============

3.01 Communications
-------------------------------

All communications will be made during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm EST, excluding holidays) and we will return any contact requests within one business day unless we notify you ahead of time that we will be out of the office. Of course we understand that emergencies do arise, so in the case of emergencies, know that our hours will be billed at twice our hourly rate. While we will make reasonable attempts to assist in emergency situations, we are unable to promise immediate support unless special retainers or amendments are added to this contract.

3.02 Medium
-------------------------------

We appreciate communication in a text-based medium, but understand that not all discussions are easily done this way. We're happy to speak to you on the phone, over Skype/Google Hangout, or in person if you are in the our area (<%= config['developer_legal_jurisdiction'] %>), keeping in mind that any decisions that are made will be written down and require your written approval.

3.03 Meetings
-------------------------------

As we value your time as well as our own, we ask that all meeting schedules be requested a minimum of two business days in advance and be accompanied by an agenda so that we can be fully prepared. If we are unable to attend a meeting at your suggested time, we will be happy to provide two times that will work for us. Meetings must start and end on or before the time allotted and will be billed whether you attend or not.
