2. Development
==============

2.01 Terms of Development
-------------------------

1. Version Control Software: Git allows us to keep track of all changes that happen in your application. This way, if a bug is introduced we can quickly find where it was added and roll back to the previous bug-free state while we fix things up! We require code be under version control so we can work on your application with your employees or other contractors without worrying that we may be undoing or overwriting each others changes.

2. Testing: We write tests before we write our code, which allows us to make sure that all required functionality is not only present, but works no matter how often we change things around. If your employees or other contractors will be working on the project along side us, we require that they also write tests for all code they produce to make sure we are all on the same page and not stepping on each others toes.

3. Coding Location: Code will be developed on our servers.  All invoices must be paid in full before code will be released to the client.
