5. Legal
===========

5.01 Limits to Liability
-----------
Although we test extensively, we can't guarantee that the functions contained in any application will always be error-free and so we can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this application and any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages. 

Software is provided as-is and can be expected to reasonably perform within the scope.  It is the client's responsibility to test the code and assure that it complies with the scope guidelines within 5 business days of receiving the final code.  If an issue is discovered after the 5 business day period, a new contract will be required at a negotiated rate.

No liability costs, in aggregate (punitive, actual, etc.), will exceed the dollar value paid by the client in this contract.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

5.02 Copyrights
----------------
First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you've permission to use them.

Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You'll own the visual elements that we create for this project. We'll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we're not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

We'll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we'll license that you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise. We can provide a separate estimate for that.

We love to show off our work and share what we've learned with other people, so we reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

5.03 Pre-Existing Intellectual Property
--------------------------------------
Any methodologies, libraries, tools, or technologies shall be and remain the sole property of <%= config['developer_company_name'] || config['developer_name'] %>.  In addition, we retain the right to use any concepts that we acquired or developed while completing this contract.

Simply put, we become more valuable to you and our other clients by virtue of learning and retain all associated rights.

5.04 Rights to Know-How
-----------------------
We may incorporate into the software we create for you various preexisting development tools, routines, subroutines, programs, data or materials (Know-How). You agree that we retain all rights, title and interest, including all copyright, patent, and trade secret rights to that Know-How. We agree that after you pay me in full, you'll receive a nonexclusive, perpetual, worldwide license to use the Know-How in the software that we created for you under this Agreement. However, you shall not resell or make use of that Know-How in any other manner other than in connection with the software you receive under this Agreement. 

5.05 Non-Compete
----------------
We are an independent company providing a service for you, the client.

Any non-compete clause must be made a party to this contract as an amendment.

The default agreement we offer is that we will not reveal your internal business behaviors.  We retain the right to continue to work with clients in all areas of business and industry.

5.06 Bringing Suit
------------------
Any party wishing to bring suit due to work performed in this contract, must bring the suit or complaint to the jurisdiction of the defending party. Our legal jurisdiction is <%= config['developer_legal_jurisdiction'] %> and yours is believed to be the state wherein you business exists.

5.07 Work Status
----------------
You agree that we are an independent contractor and not your employee. Although you will provide general direction , we will determine, in our sole discretion, the manner and ways in which we will create the software for you. The work that we create for you under this Agreement will not be deemed a "work-for-hire", as that term is defined under U.S. Copyright Law. Whatever rights we grant you are contained in this Agreement. 

5.07 Where is all the horrible small print?
-------------------------------------------
Just like a parking ticket, you cannot transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of <%= config['developer_legal_jurisdiction'] %> courts.
