This is my no nonsense, plain language freelance contract.

You can use it if you want.

Install
-------
It comes with a compile script, in the form of a Rakefile
To run it, type `rake` from the repository root.

To compile and view:
`rake view (the default task)`

To compile contract:
`rake compile`

Requirements
------------
It requires Ruby and the Markdown and HTMLDOC command line tools (`brew install markdown htmldoc` should do it on a Mac).

Legal
-----
I'm not a lawyer, and make no promises that this contract will work for you.
I assume no responsibility for any legal or other issues you may face as
a result of using this contract. YMMV.
